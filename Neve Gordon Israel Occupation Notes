Neve Gordon - Israel's Occupation

Introduction

Israel's occupation of Palestine has changed over time, control over Palestine and Palestineans always sought but character/mode of expression has shifted

Rather than a freely acting state pursuing policy and interests, actual behavior shows Israel (state in general) to be complex, aims and methods malleable

Means of control both coercive and instititutional, violence used as well as rules/laws/policies - all aiming to secure control

Israel has continued to seek control for control's sake over decades, context/justifications shift but not underlying effort to gain control

Foucault's analysis of power's different modes useful: biopower focuses on controlling a population, disciplinary power focuses on individual compliance, and sovereign power is legalistic/policy

Israel's favored mode of power in OT shifted towards pure sovereign power coupled to disciplinary power focused on the entire population as coherent unit


Chapter 1

Initial occupation build out of administrative bureaucracy tied to military governance, presented to public on both sides as temporary, tied to counter-insurgency

Important to note that modality of control - Israel's context-sensitive deployment of power - unique to Israel though form of power dominance similar to other cases

Surveillance networks including Palestineans employed, courts and permit regimes used to split out Palestineans and discipline them - extension of military organization, essentially

Law selectively enforced and tied to security concerns, though initial occupation was concerned with improving collective well-being via supporting acceptable individuals

Emphasis in early period on biopower and disciplinary power to produce self-reliant population willing to accept Israeli policy requirements, serve as labor source


Chapter 2

Post-1967 and the start of the direct military occupation of Gaza and West Bank saw push by Dayan government to render Palestineans invisible, avoid Vietnam-style occupation/insurgency

Colonialism was preferred as underlying motivation for occupation, outward emphasis on improving Palestinean lives, acting as a civilizing mission

This led to a slow consolidation of military rule and associated reduction in independent political organization, which impacted Palestinean state capacity in future

To undermine resistance pressures, Israel sought economic improvement in OT, also promoted schools, healthcare, farming support in effort to create stable OT

During this period, though occupied and surveilled, Palestine did see material improvements under Israeli domination, but apparent docility was superficial


Chapter 3

Israel undercut its own economic development efforts by restricting capital formation in OT, deployed one-way tariffs, fees, and labor controls

Actual resource base in OT actually decline despite apparent material improvements, Israel integrated the OT into own economy while also making it capital-dependent

Public works projects like roads were deployed to split up OT and laborers from OT were not fully protected under Israeli law, low-skill labor emphasized

Different modalities of control deployed, and began to intersect as occupation continued, leading to Palestinean protests that were written off as unrest by Israel

Worker exploitation, poor infrastructure, lack of opportunities brought situation to a head by '80s, all fed into occupation/control complex, created ingredients for explosion


Chapter 4

Coherent Palestinean identity difficult to form under circumstances, physical and economic divisions made state development and social solidarity difficult

Physically, Palestineans divided between OT and Jordan, and Israel actively sought to prevent Palestinean unity or Palestinean nationalism

Municipalities became essential as organizing grain, focus of what organization allowed, these mediated between Palestineans and Israelis but created major contradictions

Elections were allowed in municipalities by Israel, and were reasonably democratic, but lack of unity created conditions for later Hamas-Fatah split between communities

Israel also used the elections as focus for sovereign power, relegating roles to PNA without allowing true capacity development, and municipalities became sites of resistance


Chapter 5

Israel's desire to physically possess, occupy, and settle West Bank present from day 1, initial efforts aimed to ID heritage sites, which led to settlement buildout

Settlements were never openly planned by Israel, but effectively supported by government, as has become clear over years despite lack of formal planning/approval

The initial settlements were built on heights near Jordan to control vital access routes to WB, creating settlement buffer between WB Palestineans and Jordan side

Water was a major target for settlements, key sources controlled by their deployment, and roads were used to link settlements while dividing Palestineans

Settlements thereby served as key part of overall fragmentation of Palestinean society, making it difficult to promote pan-Palestine identity and political organization


Chapter 6

By the early '80s, clashes were occurring in West Bank on routine basis, and lethal collision between tank transporter and civilians in 1987 sparked Intifada

Intifada caught Israel by surprise despite surveillance and escalating violence, Palestineans defended themselves with burning tires, stones, flown flags, and leaflets

Experiences while working in Israel a key point of anger uniting Palestineans, but their efforts led to an Israeli crackdown and escalation of violence

Leadership emerged in Intifads, and adapted to resist by making occupation costly - Israel's response was violent with over a thousand killed and many more imprisoned

The permit regime was altered to directly control movement, hospitals refused transfers, all in all occupation adapted to growing resistance movement


Chapter 7

Palestinean Authority created after Oslo accords partly as means of outsourcing occupation duties, as argued by Said, Chomsky, and others critical of Oslo outcome

PA gave Israel a middleman of use, and a different enemy for Palestineans to deal with, but the PA was never allowed true sovereignty by Israel

Israel remained in effective control, with economic exploitation intact, partial sovereignty allowed as attempt to reduce overt violence

At this point, Israel's relationship with individuals shifted, blanket repression now deployed with little concern for welfare, which undermined PA authority

PA continually lost legitimacy in the face of Israel's actions, capacity always denied by Israel, and the situation was worsened by expansion of settlements

Israel by 1990s had stoped caring about welfare of population or individuals, effectively moving to almost pure sovereign power excluding Palestineans from Israeli society


Chapter 8

Second Intifada sparked by Sharon's visit to Temple Mount/Al Aqsa, protests were met by violence and escalation was the result

Israel itself produced fragmented conditions that led to scattered groups difficult to control, then deployed state violence excused by PA lack of capacity

Shift now from colonization to separation as core articulating principle, exclusion of Palestineans from space and consideration

Israel's escalation of violence and tactics evidence that it has abandoned concern for Palestinean humanity, destroys Palestinean governing capacity in response to attacks

Effective dehumanization of Palestineans allows Israel to kill with impunity, so biopower and disciplinary power used wholly in reactive/violent sense

Rise of Hamas and other groups like it tied to constant violence and power confrontation, with Israel and Palestine now locked in mutually destructive cycle
