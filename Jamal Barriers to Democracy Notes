Amaney Jamal - Barriers to Democracy

Chapter 1

Civil society is widely considered essential to democratization, but is not in and of itself sufficient. Clientelistic and/or authoritarian governments can take advantage of associations

Null hypothesis for civil society boosts democracy idea: Associations promote democratic values by altering attitudes and trust. Western bias present in this, most analysis of western world

Where associations are subjected to power inequality, behavior is different. Reversing causality according to Putnam, with regimes being what determines association values

Associations have to adapt to circumstance, and may evolve to represent narrow interests. Palestine offers a useful case study specifically in the PNA-civil society context

Three key dimensions of civic engagement relevant, though not all directly relate: political knowledge, civic involvement, and community engagement

PNA strongly clientalistic/patron oriented, and created strong vertical linkages between patrons and clients. This type of regime-society relationship is pervasive in Arab world

Authoritarian states tend to centralize power and oppose civil society, which has the effect of cultivating corruption in the bureaucracy

PNA actively favored supporting associations in West Bank, which undermined capability development in associations not favored by PNA


Chapter 2

Associational behavior requires a degree of civic participation, but this is always mediated by governing institutions and state power

Palestinean National Authority was/is clientelistic and the leadership actively promoted authoritarian governance in territories under its control

Israel-Palestine conflict placed organizers between Israel and the PNA, and the overriding struggle for independence subordinated civil groups to that national goal

PNA power flowed from its claim to represent all Palestinean interests, and so its effective control over access to benefits allowed it power over associations

This power dynamic heavily influenced associational life and organization, as all had to compete for regime favor in order to access capital needed to build capacity


Chapter 3

PNA clientelistic networks reproduced vertical hierarchy across society, which also forced associations to shift towards a hierarchical structure

West Bank associations were numerous and boasted high membership (democratizing force per Putnam) but were inexorably drawn into the PNA clientelistic web

Israel and international non-government organizations funneled money to Palestine through PNA, which enhanced its power and undermined pluralism

Factionalism grew in post-Oslo period and Second Intifada, further complicating matters, and some associations like Hamas gained power

So the environmental adaptations forced on associations influenced their development, and in many cases led to adoption of extremist positions


Chapter 4

Under the expectations of Putnam and his followers, civic associations should be seen to boost levels of interpersonal trust within society, which did occur in PNA-controlled West Bank

Political access mediated by support for ruling party [PNA] allowed civil society to develop to a degree in West Bank, but it was under effective PNA control

Putnam's argument and evidence captures variation between causes, but fails to account for differences in local context and how associational life actuall works

Polarization has a significant impact on trust, as winning groups are able to boost trust within their ranks - but only for those favored by successful access-mediating groups

So associational life in and of itself is not a sufficient condition for reliably promoting democracy - it works differently in a non-democratic context than in a democracy


Chapter 5

In Morocco, trust is inversely correlated to associational life, where access to patron is also decisive and pro-democracy groups are generally excluded

Under these conditions, more democracy is a goal of opposition groups who distrust state, and those groups captured by regime/benefits accept authoritarian rule

Jordan and Egypt are similarly authoritarian and clientelistic, with similarly polarized associations - those disfavored by state repressed, those in favor boosted

Regimes actively seek to prevent counter-associations from forming, and democracy promotion so tied now to US that foreign pressure exacerbates problem

Islamist opposition ends up as the primary alternative form of association/organization, and as regimes chip away at social freedoms risk of conflict rise


Chapter 6

Democracy seems to function best where democratic institutions are widely supported, civic engagement is sustained, and interpersonal trust is high

Effective and impartial institutions promote trust and civic engagement, offer disincentives to trust-violation or reneging on agreements

But trust itself is linked to material outcomes in society, which are conditional on regime access in non-democracies

Trust is structured by 1. state non-discrimination in society, and 2. Reciprocity of trust within and between groups

States create the context that determines the level of trust in society, so citizens trust for one another is structured by power at state level

When associations are subjected to favor/disfavor choice by state, issues arise, as members condition their behavior on outcomes they observe
