Jamal Of Empires and Citizens Notes

Chapter 1

Democratization has rapidly progressed after the dissolution of the USSR, but not in Arab world, in despite of economics-focused explanations of democratization

US actions have undermined democratization, causing anti-americanism in the Arab world to rise, and leaving Islamism as the primary alternative organizing force

US geopolitics intersects with Arab regime efforts to survive, and because Islamists are the major opposition parties domestic and international politics intersect

Neither political-economy nor cultural arguments alone explain the lack of democracy in Arab world, as it does harbor democratic ideals and is growing in wealth

Cultural arguments focus on civic associations, social development, or purported deeper cultural patterns, but these offer little hope for change or misunderstand history

Political-Economy focuses on growth of the middle classes and rentier tendencies to explain lack of democracy, but arguments lack firm empirical grounding and ignore history

Internal negotiations between elites and the context surrounding them are key, there is a 2-way street between domestic and international concerns

Patron-client relations are central locally and internationally, with local people conditioning support of or opposition to elites on expected impacts to their interests

Citizens will often adapt to a less-than-ideal status quo in order to secure themselves, and evaluate regime opponents' likely impact on key issues when choosing to support

US regime support helps preserve elite patronage networks, and the degree to which opposition groups also oppose US impacts citizen estimates of future patronage situation


Chapter 2

US began to actively intervene in Arab world in late 1950s, and was focused on controlling access to oil resources as well as containing possible adversaries

Collapse of the USSR reduced potential external patrons to 1, and lack of options in this regard undermined relationships/exacerbated tensions between opposition and regimes

Regimes across the Arab world rely on the US for oil security, but comparing Jordan and Kuwait is particularly illustrative

Jordan formerly focused on the United Kingdom as patron, then shifted focus to US, so harming this relationship is of concern to elites who benefit from patronage

Kuwait also shifted patronage from the UK to the US, and in 1990/1991 the United States directly intervened to militarily protect Kuwait


Chapter 3

Islamists in Jordan tied to pan-national identity, with an anti-western/anti-colonial position part of their organizational history, which has alienated elites

Jordanians are caught between the Islamist-dominated opposition and the regime, and have to consider that Islamist victory would jeapordize US patronage

Jordanian monarchy actively contests Islamic claim to represent Jordanians, but tolerates the opposition so long as it remains under control

The US opposes Islamist parties in Jordan and actively backs the regime, but in Kuwait there is little connection between Islamist parties and the US

In Kuwait, US protection is given to the entire country and secured from military bases away from civilians, while US doesn't resist democratization efforts

Islamist parties in Kuwait generally accept the geostrategic utility of American protection, and don't oppose it, and so democratization not seen by US as threat in Kuwait


Chapter 4

In Jordan, surveys show that most citizens want to maintain ties to the west, and the monarchy backs economic integration, which benefits certain groups

Monarchy is widely perceived as effectively mediating domestic-US relations and fear that a loss of US support would undermine security

In Kuwait, those surveyed see the US as maintaining relations no matter what, and the US offers security in a dangerous area, so presence tolerated

US is key to security in both, but the history and quality differs, with Islamists having a different long-term relationship between the two

Jordanians supportive of the regime stand to lose greatly if Jordan loses US patronage, and see Islamists as willing to risk Jordan's security

Islamists in Jordan use US patronage as a rhetorical tool, but in Kuwait the tendency isn't to focus on this aspect of relations


Chapter 5

Arab citizens overall tend to express support for democratic governance, but the local context controls the speed at which they tend to support democratization

Security is the overriding concern throughout the Arab world, so relationship between regime and effective provision of security is essential

US as an actor providing/undermining security conditions domestic politics, with support for globalization also tied to support for US security efforts

In Jordan, empirics show unity between regime and US support, with anti-global and anti-regime sentiments highest in groups losing out

In Kuwait, connection between regime and US support is less decisive, because all parties see US presence remaining even if monarchy loses to Islamists


Chapters 6-8 [Mostly expanding support for argument, key aspects covered above]

Extending the logic of this argument to Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and Palestine useful, as all rely on international patronage and this impacts domestic politics

Morocco also depends on the US, is highly patronage-oriented, residents are pro-democracy but fear that Islamists will jeapordize relationship with US

Morocco-US alliance endures despite Anti-American ideas widespread in country, largely because residents generally don't want to upset access to global economy

US policies definitively seen to create Anti-American attitudes that poisons domestic politics, as in Palestine where fear of Hamas props up Fatah corruption

Islamists in Saudi Arabia have violently opposed US activities, which regime uses to discredit opposition and democratization

Domestic-International interactions produce a 2-level game. Citizens may not necessarily oppose democracy, but fear who ends up in charge

US claims of superiority in supporting freedom and democracy irks Arabs, who have seen how this works, and US continually fails to recognize this as source of Anti-American attitudes

US emphasis on promoting democracy helpful, but not when it simultaneously props up regimes, which is an unfortunate continuity of US policy over many years
