Alice Kang - Bargaining for Women's Rights

Intro

Gender equality in Islamic societies an area of growing research interest and debate, amidst this real progress has occurred though clear challenges remain

Women are actively challenging discrimination in Islamic societies, and past successes have opened space for new rounds of organizing

Why states choose to adopt womens rights policies, or not, is a key question, and the case of Niger serves as a useful case

3 Key claims: Activist mobilization, lack of conservative counter-mobilization, and domestic context are key to explaining why policies adopted

Activism by women makes reforms "thinkable" which is crucial for effective agenda-setting. By contest, space is opened and problems posited require solutions

Conservative counter-activism can and at times does hinder women's activisim, and their aims can go against those of womens'groups

This situation holds across the world, with pushback to women's gains common, but these are not insurmountable in the right context

States are not unitary actors, and internal context is key to understanding how they behave as much as the external context

Domestically, power sharing between state and religious groups impact women, churches may promote conservative vision embedded in power structure

But there is little evidence that Islam is inherently bad for women, again the local context matters. Islam has as much variation as Christianity in this


Chapter 1

French colonial rule heavily influenced Niger, the underlying social fabric was heavily impacted by imposition of French legal system

France spread control over complex pre-existing society where elites competed and different regions exhibited different patterns of rule

France effectively played divide and conquer, suppressing revolts while allying with some groups. Slow extension fused with underlying power structure

French concept of legality passed through local male chieftain rule, which led to a system of paired Islamic and chief functional governance and French overall control

French administrators imposed rules according to their own patriarchial vision and values, which were often male-oriented and unresponsive to women's interests


Chapter 2

Combination of passive secular state and chieftain power creates a complex environment, and authoritarian rulers post-independence were not focused on womens issues

Women's organizations were established and grew alongside Islamic groups, but these were not inherently oppositional and power was still diffused in society

Governments responded slowly to internal and external pressures, women's groups used what they had to promote acceptance of a basic family code

Church groups began to oppose women's groups in '90s and focused on this law, using the technique of 'curses' to threaten movement, which impeded progress

Groups began to bargain, and women's groups were forced to be strategic in the battles they chose, as the state-church connection in Niger was difficult to surmount


Chapter 3

By engaging democratic processes in the post 1990s, womens groups made gains via careful use of rhetoric and bargaining not directly focused on womens-only issues

Successful adoption of quota in parliament for women was a major boost, many ways to implement such gender quotas, but virtually any appears to create real progress

Women's activists focused on under-representation as a key issue, could advance their cause without vulnerability to opposition on religious grounds

Key MPs in parliament at the time were committed to seeking consensus to avoid breaking apart Niger's young democratic government, which allowed women room to advocate

Lack of counter-mobilization and the spread of supportive international norms helpful, but not decisive - underlying acceptance of growing female role in society helpful


Chapter 4

Still, counter-mobilization serves as a major impediment to progress, as shown by comparing CEDAW acceptance and Maputo protocol rejection in Niger

Democratization allowed many groups greater voice and role in politics, which allowed space for structural bargaining changes in power complex

Women proved able to sustain mobilization efforts throughout CEDAW ratification process, which allowed them to continue bargaining even with hostile groups

Maputo Protocol failure tied to lack of effectiveness in contemporary women's organization, which was undercut by certain contextual factors and counter-mobilization

International pressure likely helped pressure actors to accept new norms, but not effective when these norms were at odds with local social values


Conclusion

Sustained activism crucial in successful promotion of womens rights, and tactics can range from strategic use of symbols, active negotiations, to ideal promotion

Thinkability is essential point of contention between womens groups and conservative groups, and can be aided by linking to international norms/organizations

Women in conservative/Islamic societies are engaged in a contest for greater rights, but this contestation takes local, contextual forms

Domestic actors are diverse, as are international actors, and reconciling this diversity crucial, also recognizing that context matters deeply in understanding processes
