Brownleee, Masoud, and Reynolds - The Arab Spring

Intro and Chapter 1

End of the Cold War seemed to offer hope of democratic reform throughout the Arab World, but conflict in 90's and US foreign policy in '00s undermined that idea

Prior Arab Springs actually led to more democratization than recent wave, this one ran into similar difficulties and largely collapsed

Many have argued for inherent tension between democracy and the Arab/Muslim world, but this is not borne out in reality

Arab world does exhibit commonality, but in political dynamics, and this similarity allows for making structural comparisons to assess impacts on Arab Spring outcomes

Failure to accept that democracy and authoritarianism are linked impedes analysis, and regime collapse doesn't necessarily lead to democratization

Not all Arab countries had uprisings in this wave, not all regimes fell, so there is potential to sort outcomes and look for structural similarities

Actor-based theories influential in field, but in fact the power relations inherent in Arab political world limit scope of actor action

Many comparativists focus on instutions, regime types, and culture, this study finds control of resources to be most decisive


Chapter 2

"State violence was the political fulcrum of the Arab Spring, regimes faltered only when armies turned against autocrats"

This effect requires explanation, with oil rents and hereditary rule proposed as causal by authors, who argue that dynastic regimes with oil wealth survived

Oil wealth allows a regime to buy off the people and/or military, and powerful dynasties have sought to use wealth to pursue dynasty and military control

Democratic style proto-opposition present throughout the Arab World, but extreme interventions by dictators have held reform back

Control of oil rents and disposition of benefits essential to regime survival, leading families control resources/rents and shape regime

But this is more difficult in oil-poor regimes, or where power is dispersed, with non-hereditary regimes proving more vulnerable in Arab Spring

Lack of resources or poor control of military undermined regimes, but inverse also true: oil rents underpin regime survival


Chapter 3

Tunisia, Egypt, and Yemen saw armed forces back protestors over regime, all had limited despotic control over more independent military

Bahrain, Syria, Libya had different regime-military relationship, in Bahrain regime bought military loyalty, Syria and Libya regime had only partial control

Tunisia saw military refuse to attack protestors, as in Egypt, Libya and Syria saw military split but regime forces stronger than rebels

Libyan regime fell after massive NATO airstrike campaign destroyed military capabilities, but lack of political consolidation in aftermath led to Libya's collapse

Outcomes in all tied closely to pre-existing regime character, despite the broader public perception of mass protest toppling dictators


Chapter 4

Even where regimes did fall, post-collapse order was impacted by pre-existing structures and patterns of power, in Egypt military contined to play decisive role

Yemen's old north-south divide was re-established and civil war was the result, Libya and Syria wracked by persistent civil conflict long after regime collapse

Democratic transitions typically viewed as completed when power exhanges hands peacefully, but this has only tentatively taken place in Tunisia

Egypt had the best organized opposition party, Islamic Brotherhood, win subsequent elections, prompting military intervention to re-establish power

Morsi in Egypt over-reached and prompted the military coup in order to prevent Islamist rule, with at least partial acceptance by many secular protestors

In Tunisia, opposition parties quickly began to organize to compete in elections, but non-Islamist parties were there able to successfully organize

Libya attempted to hold elections, but parties quickly divided and provess broke down, Libya now exists functionally divided with unstable institutions


Chapter 5

Actor-based approaches focus on group interests to explain transitions, but these often suffer from severe reverse-causality issues

Dividing process of democratization into completion and maintenance stages useful, with government election requiring existing state capacity and lack of coup

Interests of competing actors tied to prior conditions, so underlying social structure, history of how authority deployed, both decisive

Existing state origins go back to the Ottoman breakup after WW1, many states never saw power concentrated in functioning government

Opposition groups may become powerful, but they often fight one another, and those with more power historically used it to pursue interests with state

In the end, military organizations are essential to understand regime collapse because their role directly and severely impacts course of events


Chapter 6

Self-immolation of Tunisian served as the spark for Arab Spring round, but was not itself decisive - structural factors determined risk and course of regime collapse

Longer-term impact of Arab Spring still unknown, but income levels in absence of oil important predictive factor in course of regime collapse/democratization

Personalistic regimes allied to powerful and loyal military apparatus recipe for survival, and much of the dynastic Arab world largely unaffected by Arab Spring

Foreign Induced Regime Change can destroy military power of regime, but this in and of itself is insufficient to secure an improved outcome
