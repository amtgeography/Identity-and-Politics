Mark Tessler - A History of the Israel-Palestine Conflict

Chapter 1

Israel's origins go back millenia, with the Levant having been occupied by humans for tens of thousands of years, and Judaism is as complex as the landscape that it emerged from

Judaism is itself best defined as a complex integration of a people's collective history and memory of ancient kingdoms and the long legal tradition of Judaism

Ancient Israel had its turn as empire, but was caught up in broader Mesopotamia power struggles and defeated, leading to Jewish diaspora around world

Judaism was able to hold together via a common conception of community, even nationhood, that persisted despite physical separations of diaspora

Jewish experiences varied by region, Islam traditionally supportive of and friendly to Jews, while Christian Europe enshrined violent repression of Jews

Spain in particular a useful contrast, with syncretic society under Islamic rule leading to intellectual advancements, until Christian conquests led to the inquisition

Forced conversions and execution in Spain, separate legal status in Germany, pogroms in Eastern Europe - by 19th century question of integration or Zionism growing in relevance

Liberation from this state of affairs thought achievable by assimilation into European society by some, others favored autonomous communities, others a return to their ancient homeland

Vicious return of anti-semitism in Europe in late 19th/early 20th century added impetus, many flavors of Zionism emerged and flourished in this time

Different Zionist groups began to organize migration to holy land, and by WWI this shift was self-sustaining, creating some tension with local residents of Palesting

Despite tensions, initial settlement/migration was often supported by local Arabs who needed political allies and economic development, unfortunately tensions undercut mutuality


Chapter 2

Palestineans descend from the Canaanites and Philistines of the Levant, who lived alongside Jews in the ancient world until the Empire of Israel absorbed/controlled them

Destruction of ancient Israel left Palestineans as majority, and when Islam came centuries later Palestineans were Arab-ized and Islam-ized, local Jews protected as 'People of the Book'

Arab is actually a problematic term, tied to cultural influence and language rather than ethnicity, with Palestineans making up one branch/lineage in broader Arab world

Islamic society grew in stages, Muhammad's campaigns against Mecca and Medina led to rapid expansion of Caliphate after his death, conquests to Persia and Spain

Umayyad elites of the First Caliphate not particularly religious, held privileges and wealth in hereditary lineages but were fairly tolerant on spiritual matters

Split of the Caliphate into regional territories followed, and the Mongol conquests deely traumatized Islamic society via destruction of intellectual capitol Baghdad

Ottoman Empire grew up in wake of Mongol conquests, eventually formed one of the largest coherent political entities in the region, heavily determining development of regions

Napoleonic invasion of Egypt prompted major Ottoman reforms and general social awakening, but European colonialism grew in scope and power over century

Imperialism directed at Arab world badly fractured what unity it had forged, creating an ideological climate not conducive to reform as Europeans grew more dangerous


Chapter 3

Initially, contacts between Jewish settlers of the Zionist movement and the Arab residents were minimal, as the incomers build their own societies and communities

Local Jews and Arabs found many opportunities for beneficial cooperation, and leaders sought to deconflict wherever they could to avoid unnecessary problems

First World War saw Ottoman repression increase, Arabs were conscripted and Jews too forced to support war effort, and common cause existed against Ottoman rule

Britain began to intervene in order to weaken Ottoman rule, emphasizing support for Jewish interests and promoting Zionism as part of broader strategy

Zionists and Arabs saw mutual opportunity in cooperation, but Britain made separate appeals to both sides that undercut this movement towards possible collaboration

Conflict was always likely between Arabs and Jews due to conflicting interests over land and resources, but Britain's games destroyed hope of agreement

Steady Jewish immigration altered the balance of power in one direction, land prices rose, and Jewish preferences for Jewish labor emerged, all leading to a conflict

Arab and Jewish communities began to develop as independently as they could, creating a dual society characterized by mutual fear and power struggle


Chapter 4

Jewish society in Palestine shaped by two major waves of migration, and the establishment early on of independent self-defense forces like Haganah

Active development of Jewish communities accelerated in inter-war period, capital flowed in powered in part by investments from members of the diaspora

Democratic multi-party system adapted to British tendencies led to a diverse intellectual, ideological climate with many different ideas for how to proceed

Zionists faced deteriorating relationship with Britain as their goals conflicted with British Empire's, while Nazi rise to power gave impetus to idea of Jewish homeland

Palestinean population was also growing rapidly in inter-war period, but was not unified: divided by community and particular faith traditions, competition ensued

Clan leaders took advantage of opportunities to amass wealth and prestive, using control of key institutions to maintain rates of wealth accumulation

Labor shifts began in the area as economic growth continued, which allowed for some independence from leaders as the middle class gained strength

Political change followed, with diverse groups striving to achieve goals, but Arab revolt broke domestic civil society down leaving other states as Palestinean 'voice'

By the late '30s, violence was becoming everyday, and Britain began to move towards partition as solution - then the outbreak of war overwhelmed the efforts

Holocaust deeply shocked the world, enhancing the argument for a Jewish state, but violence in Palestine grew until outbreak of Independence war in 1948, and Israel's victory


Chapter 5

Independence War left Israel in control of large swathes of Palestinean-majority land, while the rest of Palestine was effectively absorbed by neighboring Arab states

Jordan's annexation of West Bank eliminated chance of independent Palestine there, leaving Palestineans caught between Israel and Arab leaders

Palestineans fled and were forced to evacuate, leading to vast numbers of internally and externally displaced people, with a dramatic effect on Palestinean consciousness

Palestinean-Zionist conflict was subsumed into Israel-Arab conflict, with the refugees caught in the middle with no reliable representation or hope of solution

Israel claims ancestral right to lands, and the historic oppression of Jews gives credence to need for homeland, while Arabs view Israel as a European settler colony

Both sides deployed violence and terror against  the other, and Israeli leaders did not prevent effective ethnic cleansing of Palestineans in 1948

Israel continues to deny right of return to expelled and their descendents, Jerusalem is claimed by both sides as capitol, and US has interfered throughout

Access to holy places remains major point of contention between both sides, many are shared so control created problems, but Arab states have also exacerbated situation


Chapter 6

Palestinean conflict largely subsumed for decades, with Israel-Arab wars, occupation of Golan and Sinai in 1956, 1967, major focus on conflict during that time

Egypt-Israel conflict most serious as result of Israel push to Suez, exacerbated by the movement of Nasser towards the Soviet camp and his pan-Arab ideals

Water rights became a severe point of contention with Syria, as Israel has actively sought strategic control of water resources as part of overall strategy

Difficult economic situation and political upheavals caused conflation between different issues, Palestinean politics churning further complicated situation

Rise of groups like the PLO and Fatah dated to this time, and militant action rose to fore as occupation continued into the 1980s

1966 and 1967 saw drift to war and Israel's surprise victory, putting them in direct control of West Bank and Gaza, putting Palestinean issue back to the fore

Period wracked by miscalulations on all sides, action creating new problems that make the overall situation incredibly complex and fraught

Israel's overall security position much improved by 1967, but War of Attrition with Egpyt over Suez and hostility from Syria led directly to near-disaster of 1973


Chapter 7

Israeli-Palestinean conflict and Israel-Arab conflict both subsumed into broader Cold War by 1970s, creating a set of complex and dynamic relationships

Jordan effectively realized that war was no longer possible and sought accord with Israel, even as latter moved to effectively annex West Bank via settlements

UN 242 was passed and along with 1947 Partition plan a crucial development, proposed Israeli withdrawal and acceptance of Israel along with freedom of navigation at sea

UN 242 utilized constructive ambiguity to ensure passage, but has remained highly influential and starting point for negotiations, still failed to address Palestinean status

Failure of Arab states left Palestineans aware that they were responsible for their own liberation, and unified Palestinean governing structure formed with PLO as leading power

Shaky PLO foundations tied to divisions in Palestine made it a difficult partner, but negotiations prompted PLO to express a fairly progressive vision

Confrontations continued in occupied territories and refugee campus, and the failure of states like Jordan to address Palestinean concerns led to civil war in that country

Combat between Palestinean fedayeen and Jordanian troops was accompanied by hijackings and assassination attempts, which were collective a setback for Palestinean aspirations


Chapter 8

Occupied territories of West Bank and Gaza key focal point of conflict, occupation brought Israelis in direct contact with the occupied and this caused conflict evolution

Internally Israel divided between Zionists seeking annexation of West Bank, while others tended to be more cautious, concerned about practicalities

Israel's Jewish character/majority point of agreement internally, and voting rights were not extended to Palestineans in OT

Sharon led a military repression effort and used violence on large scale, but at the same time other policy initiatives sought to promote development

1973 war produced crisis in Israel, which nearly lost despite coming out on top, shaking confidence and bringing a new mindset to the fore

Intel failures and weakness of senior leaders offset by initiative and competence of junior officers and soldiers, who adapted to save Israel from a nearly-desperate situation

Arab world, by contrast, saw 1973 as offering evidence of progress, and Israel's partial withdrawal from Sinai along with UN buffer allowed disengagement from conflict flashpoints

PLO during this time made gains among Palestineans and internationally, election results surprised Israel and demonstrated growing Palestinean capability to organize

In 1977, Likud took power in shock election and maintained it in part by promising more settlements for new migrants, while Sadat of Egypt visited Israel, offering path to peace. 

Egyptian peace initiative led to Camp David Accord and broader peace process, but provisions relating to OT undercut by Likud policy and settlements


Chapter 9

Palestinean power and solidarity came at a time of division in Israel, and violence between occupied and settlers grew in 1980s

Many Israelis on both sides of religious divide favored peace, but Likud hardliners remained in power and actively funded settlements

Censorship efforts within WB roused Palestinean public anger, and annexations further inflamed sentiments, while similar actions in Golan impacted Druze there

Hope of peace after Israel-Egypt agreement impacted Palestinean protests and resistance, as their agitation was cast against the rapproachment of the Arab states with Israel

Repression in OT continued, and then Israel launched war against PLO operating in Lebanon, in response to shelling and deployment of SAM air defenses by Syria

PLO mostly escaped, though lost bases and was scattered, but Israel's international reputation suffered badly, and was drawn into fighting with Syria in Lebanon

Spillover of Palestinean-Israeli conflict to Lebanon led to a devastating civil war there, with the massacres of Shabra and Shatila by Israeli Phalangist allies not stopped

Internally the war in Lebanon turned public opinion against the war due to costs, and many Israeli's realized their country's credibility was badly damaged by conflict


Chapter 10

Reagan era brought a new US involvement, with US support for Israel growing despite attempts to rein in abuses and Israel's rejection of giving OT to neighbors

Two-state solution once again came to fore, backed by US, against the backdrop of PLO survival/weakening in Lebanon and intersection with Cold War

Getting Israel and Syria both out of Lebanon proved difficult, and the US direct intervention in Lebanon proved counter-productive set off new rounds of violence

Fatah's split from the PLO caused Palestinean cause serious problems, splitting territory and leadership, but Israel was similarly divided internally at this point

Growth of certain settler terror groups noted  during this time, and added to conflict, with all leadership having difficulty keeping up control

Israel was in the 1980s politically divided with the exit of Begin and economically challenged, which intersected with Palestinean anger that grew into the Intifada


Chapter 11

1987 Intifada was sparked by an accident, which led to protests. IDF violent response only exacerbated protests, which then spread and escalated

Protests between Palestineans and Israelis in Jerusalem added fuel to fire, but main underlying structural driver was loss of effective Arab support for Palestinean aspirations

Desperation led to steadfastness ethic, and a sense that self-help was all Palestine would get. Youth heavily represented among protestors in First Intifada

Multiple strategies of resistance were employed, from non-violent protest and demonstration to direct confrontation, Mosques a crucial organizing institution for protests

Hamas emerged amid the struggle, combining a particular religious identity with contrast of Palestinean/Israeli identity/culture to produce coherent organization

Intifada gained coherence and momentum through shared message of liberation, exposing contradictions and myths of occupation, repression unpopular within Israel

Success of efforts and anger at Israeli tactics opened new door for diplomacy, and Jordan began to disengage from WB allowing possibility of independent Palestine there

Israel even felt the need to offer some interesting potential concessions, but the outbreak of the Gulf War refocused international attention and created new tensions

Settlements during this time became ever more entrenched, and a growing factor in conflict, as resentment began to run so deep that diplomacy was hindered


Chapter 12 and Epilogue

Oslo was intended to negotiate an end to the conflict, and scene was set by electoral victory of Labor party in Israel, US interest and confidence, and Palestinean resistance

New round of violence complicated matters, but new types of mediation and secret talks made progress, leading to the Oslo agreement

Palestineans not of one mind with respect to Oslo, Gaza/West Bank and Hamas/Fatah had different views, but Israel-Arab normalization led to hope of peace

Terrorism deeply affected Israel during Oslo years, undermining accord and delivering victory to Likud hardliner Netanyahu, limiting hope of progress

Settlements continued to expand while the withdrawal from Lebanon proceeded, but territorial struggles continued and terrorism deteriorated security situation

By 2000s Oslo was clearly in serious difficulty, with neither side now willing to trust the other enough to make progress. Hardliner rule only entrenched the conflict
